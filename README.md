# Crowdfunding_ETL
Project 2 for UofO/edX data analysis bootcamp
Resource data files and starter code provided by UofO/edX. 

ETL project creates and edits pandas dataframes of category, subcategory, contacts and campaign information.  We then created an ERD and all the corresponding tables to load the data into Postgresql.
